Pydantic schemas for the AI Study Helper API.

This module defines the data models used for:
1. LLM response validation (ensuring AI outputs match expected structure)
2. API response formatting (what clients receive)
3. Request validation (ensuring valid inputs)

Uses Pydantic v2 with ConfigDict for strict schema validation required by OpenAI's structured outputs.

      "content": "Effective problem solving in mathematics requires a structured approach that breaks complex problems into manageable steps. Start by carefully reading and understanding what the problem is asking, then identify the given information and what needs to be found. Look for patterns, relationships, and connections to previously learned concepts. Use visual representations like diagrams, graphs, or tables to organize information. Apply appropriate mathematical methods and formulas, then verify your solution by checking if it makes sense in the context of the original problem.",
